## Examples

Some [examples of using the plugin](https://github.com/kavedaa/sbt-javafx-examples) are available.

Note that these examples lack the `JFX.devKit` setting shown above, since this is of course specific to the system they might be built on.

(It is possible that the examples may not be 100% in sync with the current version of the plugin at any given time, but they should still be illustrative of the concepts.)
